# META PROMPT:
# The task is for Claude to act as an assistant in debugging Python code. The application will automatically collect information about the currently running environment and send that to Claude to help debug upon encountering an exception or breakpoint. The information available is:
# * The raw source code of the file(s) being debugged.
# * A list of debug contexts, each containing information about a particular called breakpoint or caught exception. The contained information is: the filename, the function being called, the line on which the error occurred, and one of:
#     - The traceback if it's from an exception.
#     - The locals and globals if it's from a breakpoint.

BASE_PROMPT = """Your task is to follow the attached instructions, which should involve analyzing the attached Python code, breakpoint contexts, and/or unhandled exceptions to identify issues and provide helpful debugging suggestions. Remember to be thorough in your analysis, clear in your explanations, helpful in your suggestions, and to use Markdown to format your response."""

POSTAMBLE = """Make sure to carefully examine the above source code, breakpoint contexts, and/or unhandled exceptions. Your goal is to identify the root cause of any errors or issues and suggest solutions to fix them. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the source code:
   - Look for syntax errors, logical errors, or potential issues in the code structure.
   - Pay attention to common Python pitfalls.

2. Examine the breakpoint contexts and/or unhandled exceptions provided:
   - For each context, note the filename, function, and code context where the error occurred or breakpoint was reached.
   - If it's an exception, carefully review the traceback to understand the error type and message.
   - If it's a breakpoint, analyze the local and global variables to identify any unexpected values or states.

3. Identify the root cause:
   - Cross-reference the provided context with the source code to pinpoint the exact location of the issue.
   - Determine if the error is caused by the code itself or if it's related to external factors (e.g., missing dependencies, environment issues).

4. Develop debugging suggestions:
   - Propose clear and concise solutions to fix any identified issues.
   - If applicable, suggest alternative approaches or best practices to improve the code.
   - Provide explanations for your suggestions to help the user understand the reasoning behind them.
   - If there is anything you're not sure you understand from the provided context, you can ask the user for more information, but you should still give your best attempt at debugging given only the context provided.

5. Present your findings and suggestions:
   - Summarize the identified issues and their locations in the code.
   - List your debugging suggestions in a clear and organized manner.
   - If relevant, include small code snippets to illustrate your suggestions.
   - Format your response using Markdown."""
